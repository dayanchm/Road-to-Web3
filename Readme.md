# <h3>What is Web3?</h3>

<a name="web3">
Web3 is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web which incorporates concepts such as decentralization, blockchain technologies, and token-based economics.Some technologists and journalists have contrasted it with Web 2.0, wherein they say data and content are centralized in a small group of companies sometimes referred to as "Big Tech".The term "Web3" was coined in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, and the idea gained interest in 2021 from cryptocurrency enthusiasts, large technology companies, and venture capital firms. Some commentators argue that Web3 will provide increased data security, scalability, and privacy for users and combat the influence of large technology companies. Others have raised concerns about the decentralized web component of Web3, citing the potential for low moderation and the proliferation of harmful content.Some have expressed concerns over the centralization of wealth to a small group of investors and individuals, or a loss of privacy due to more expansive data collection. Others, such as Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey, have argued that Web3 only serves as a buzzword or marketing term.

# <h3>What is a Decentralized Application?</h3>

<a name="dapp">
 When you’ll have learned about the blockchain, nodes, consensus, and all the main components of this technology, you’ll start to wonder:

“What kind of applications can I develop using the blockchain?”

The applications built on top of Blockchain are called Decentralized applications, or DApps, and have:

- A standard Front-end built using JavaScript or frameworks/libraries like React, Vue, Svelte, and so on.
- A Solidity/Solana/Rust backend, built on top of the blockchain.
